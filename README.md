# The_snake_game
This is snake game on steroids

Why on steroids? becouse you can choose speed of your snake,
and also you can choose mode :
- if you want obstacles or now.

Dont forget to type your nickname! If you wont you cant play...
Its a must to remember your scores and apply this in ranking.

There is also rangking of games for obstacles and without.
You will see last 10 games (points and nickname of players)
and also you will the best one in hisotory in game. 
Ranking can be reseted co you can apply seasons in this game.


There are 4 levels of speed from easy to ultra, the more speed snake have, then more hard game is to stay,

The goal is to collect rectangles(food) and to avoid hitting:
wall, obstalces if added or walls.

The steering is based on keyboard arrows. You can only move in 
4 directions. You can go back if you are goint to the front currently. You can only move in one axis, if any axis is choosen you have to change asix to move (like if you are goint front, then you can only go left or right...)

Thank you!

I did all the graphics by connecting pgs from the internet.
